                ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,—
                While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
                As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
                "'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;
                Only this and nothing more."

                Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
                And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
                Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
                From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore,
                For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:
                Nameless here for evermore.
